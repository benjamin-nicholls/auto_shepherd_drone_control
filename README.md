# Group 3 – Baa Force One 

## Goal:
To provide the 'eye in the sky'. Develop the infrastructure for streaming the data from the provided drone, and automating the collection process to ensure the highest quality of data is available, surveying commercial solutions in the process. 

## Preparation in Advance:
Ensure your device has the following installed / available: 
- ROS2 Humble (Installed with Ubuntu or as a Docker image) 
- VS Code
- Android Studio

## Activities:
### Primary Activity:
`Real-Time Data Streaming` – Utilising the DJI Mobile SDK v5, create an Android application to stream Video, GPS, Camera Information (EXIF/Pose), and Telemetry Data into the ROS2 system. 

### Secondary Activity: 
`Remote Tele-Operation` – Developing the Android application further, integrate capabilities to send the drone to given coordinates, generating flight plans and risk assessments for manual approval. 

### Stretch Activity:
`Autonomous Planning` – With the positions of detected targets received, develop an approach to autonomously manoeuvring the drone to keep the targets within the frame, making considerations to battery lifetime and hot-swapping drones. 

## Outcomes:
With the completion of these activities, the group will have the necessary pipelines in place for connecting data streams to the other groups in the project for consumption into ROS2 processes. 

## Future Engagement:
Further to the week, members will have the opportunity to engage with dynamic drone autonomy and advanced ariel planning with sheep monitoring. Members will also be encouraged to package and publish the developed application for use as a toolset for research beyond shepherding.
